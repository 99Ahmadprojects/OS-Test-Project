            This collaborative web project was created by our BSCS 5th Semester team as part of the
            Operating Systems course project. The purpose of this work is to practice teamwork and demonstrate
            how multiple members can collaborate on a single repository using Git. Our goal is to create a
            simple yet well-organized webpage that reflects each member’s contribution.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We are a team of BSCS students in the 5th Semester at Riphah International University,
            working together to complete our Operating Systems collaborative project.
            Each member is responsible for a specific part of the development process to ensure
            teamwork and learning through Git collaboration.
        </p>

        <h3>Team Members & Tasks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sharaiz Ahmed [57288]</strong> – Responsible for creating the main HTML structure and layout of the webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>Shahid Zaman [55123]</strong> – Handling CSS design and styling to make the webpage visually appealing and responsive.</li>
            <li><strong>Mir Ahmed Shah [54906]</strong> – Implementing JavaScript features to add interactivity and functionality to the webpage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each team member contributes to their assigned part and commits changes to the shared Git repository.
            This ensures that all tasks are coordinated, and everyone’s work is clearly visible through version-control history.
