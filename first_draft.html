        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This collaborative web project is created by our BSCS team pf 5th semester as part of our Operating Systems semester project. 
            The purpose of this project is to practice teamwork and demonstrate how multiple members can work together 
            on a single repository using Git.
        </p>

        <h3>Team Members & Tasks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sharaiz Ahmed [57288]</strong> – Responsible for creating the main HTML structure and content layout.</li>
            <li><strong>Shahid Zaman [55123]</strong> – Handling CSS design and page styling to make the interface attractive and responsive.</li>
            <li><strong>Mir Ahmed Shah [54906]</strong> – Working on JavaScript functionalities to make the webpage interactive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each team member is contributing to their specific part and will commit changes to the shared Git repository.
            This ensures that all tasks are well-coordinated and everyone’s work is clearly visible through version control history.
